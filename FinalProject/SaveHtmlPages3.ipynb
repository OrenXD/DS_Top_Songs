it when I see you again\\nWe've come a long way from where we began\\nOh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again\\nWhen I see you againDamn, who knew?\\nAll the planes we flew\\nGood things we've been through\\nThat I'd be standing right here talking to you\\n'Bout another path\\nI know we loved to hit the road and laugh\\nBut something told me that it wouldn't last\\nHad to switch up\\nLook at things different, see the bigger picture\\nThose were the days, hard work forever pays\\nNow I see you in a better place, uhHow could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?\\nEverything I went through, you were standing there by my side\\nAnd now you gon' be with me for the last rideIt's been a long day without you, my friend\\nAnd I'll tell you all about it when I see you again\\nWe've come a long way from where we began\\nOh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again\\nWhen I see you againFirst, you both go out your way\\nAnd the vibe is feeling strong\\nAnd what's small turned to a friendship\\nA friendship turned to a bond\\nAnd that bond will never be broken\\nThe love will never get lostAnd when brotherhood come first\\nThen the line will never be crossed\\nEstablished it on our own\\nWhen that line had to be drawn\\nAnd that line is what we reached\\nSo remember me when I'm goneHow could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?\\nEverything I went through, you were standing there by my side\\nAnd now you gon' be with me for the last rideSo let the light guide your way, yeah\\nHold every memory as you go\\nAnd every road you take\\nWill always lead you home, homeIt's been a long day without you, my friend\\nAnd I'll tell you all about it when I see you again\\nWe've come a long way from where we began\\nOh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again\\nWhen I see you againWhen I see you again (see you again, yeah)\\nWhen I see you again\", \"I might never be your knight in shining armour\\nI might never be the one you take home to mother\\nAnd I might never be the one who brings you flowers\\nBut I can be the one, be the one tonightWhen I first saw you\\nFrom across the room\\nI could tell that you were curious,\\nOh, yeah\\nGirl, I hope you're sure\\nWhat you're looking for\\n'Cause I'm not good at making promisesBut if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms\\nAnd if you like having secret little rendezvous\\nIf you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do\\nThen baby, I'm perfect\\nBaby, I'm perfect for you\\nAnd if you like midnight driving with the windows down\\nAnd if you like going places we can't even pronounce\\nIf you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about\\nThen baby, you're perfect\\nBaby, you're perfect\\nSo let's start right nowI might never be the hands you put your heart in\\nOr the arms that hold you any time you want them\\nBut that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment\\n'Cause I can be the one you love from time to timeWhen I first saw you\\nFrom across the room\\nI could tell that you were curious,\\nOh, yeah\\nGirl, I hope you're sure\\nWhat you're looking for\\n'Cause I'm not good at making promisesBut if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms\\nAnd if you like having secret little rendezvous\\nIf you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do\\nThen baby, I'm perfect\\nBaby, I'm perfect for you\\nAnd if you like midnight driving with the windows down\\nAnd if you like going places we can't even pronounce\\nIf you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about\\nThen baby, you're perfect\\nBaby, you're perfect\\nSo let's start right nowAnd if you like cameras flashing every time we go out,\\nOh, yeah\\nAnd if you're looking for someone to write your break-up songs about\\nBaby, I'm perfect\\nBaby, we're perfectIf you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms\\nAnd if you like having secret little rendezvous\\nIf you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do\\nThen baby, I'm perfect\\nBaby, I'm perfect for you\\nAnd if you like midnight driving with the windows down\\nAnd if you like going places we can't even pronounce\\nIf you like to do whatever
